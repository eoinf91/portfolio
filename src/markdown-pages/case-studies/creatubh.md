projectOverview: "I entrusted myself with the task of curating a user-centric website for a new design agency which I was planning to start-up in 2021. This site is mainly an informative site, with the overall goal of the site to get the user to contact the agency."
designTeam: "Eoin Feely"
duration: "1 month"

uxResearch01: "As I started working a full-time job, this stage of the process wasn’t fully carried out. However, using my knowledge of design agencies, having worked in them in the past and also having worked alongside many clients, I felt I had a large understanding of what any user on the site would be looking for."
uxResearch02: "This made the process rather straightforward along with having the content curated at the start of the project meant mapping the site out would make this project flow smoothly."
