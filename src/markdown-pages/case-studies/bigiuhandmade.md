uxResearch01: "Due to client budgets, we were unable to conduct a full UX strategy on the project. Instead, I used my alternative solution to create a strong user centric experience by fully understanding the business goals and putting myself in the shoes of the user. Although this is not the best practice for any UX project, when the budget is tight, it is a good alternative."
uxResearch02: "As part of getting to know the Bigiu Handmade brand, I spent time looking into other small business sites, craft business and understanding the experience they gave to their users. From my findings, it was as expected that most businesses in this area focus on getting sales so the shop is the main priority on the site."
