projectOverview: "I was trusted with the task of curating a website that needed a lot of attention to detail due to the nature of work the client carries out. The main goal of the site was for potential patients to easily get in touch with the company but also to build trust in what Neuropraxis does and its processes."

uxResearch01: "Due to client budgets, the UX research phase wasnâ€™t carried out. This was replaced by calls with the clients to really get an understanding of what they do and how important a role they play in their users lives."
uxResearch02: "I also took inspiration from the success stories of the patients and although I am unable to relate to what these users would be going through on a daily basis, my goal was to use the empathy and feelings I had when watching these success stories to come across on the site."
